### react + firebase demo

##### written for a video by Benjamin Davis

To try this out on your own machine simply add a .env with the following variables:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGE_SENDER_ID=""
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""
```

You will need a firebase project which you can create at: https://console.firebase.google.com/

This is not the greatest demo in the world, but it should give you an idea of how Firebase looks in a React App.
